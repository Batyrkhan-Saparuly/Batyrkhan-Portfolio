        <h2>Game Description</h2>
        <p>A3-Dcollect-a-thon traversal game revolving around a lizardman who is attempting to scale
            a mountain. As you progress the game by collecting runes (or power-ups), you can access
            further areas which will allow you to steadily scale the mountain.</p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Venturing into Unreal Engine and its Blueprints system marked a significant challenge due to its complex learning curve. 
                This was my inaugural experience with both the engine and the framework. It took me a lot of time to understand how Blueprints and UE5 work in general.</li>
            <li>It was my first time working with a team on such a big project, and it was quite challenging to adapt to the whole process. I faced the difficulties from the beginning, when we had to form our teams, since I was not as experienced as other Tech Artists</li>
            <li>The main challenge for our team was the Version Control, none of us had enough will and time to understand Git LFS, and we ended up losing a lot of time because of that.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="version-control">
        <h2>Version Control</h2>
        <p>Started with GitHub, transitioned to Git LFS. However, none of us could really figure out how to effectively use Git LFS and how to merge properly. So we ended up simply using Google Drive to manage and merge different versions of the game. 
            It was not very effective, since one of us had to download all of the versions to then merge all the Blueprints, Sounds, UIs and etc to one version.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="code-architecture">
        <h2>Code Architecture</h2>
        <p>Focused on the code for the main menu and pause menu, implemented fully using Unreal Engine's Blueprint system. Also worked on the UI for the widgets. Implemented the save/load functionalities, incorporated within the main and pause menus. That took the most time, since incorporating so many connected things was confusing. Most of the work for Save/Load is done in GameInstance, where I created the functions.</p>

        <h2>What I Learned</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Blueprint Mastery: Advanced my skills in using Unreal Engine’s Blueprint system to handle complex UI interactions and game functionalities.</li>
            <li>Sound Integration: Improved ability to implement dynamic sound environments, which significantly enhances the immersive experience of the game. I worked closely with my team when designing and editing the SFX.</li>
            <li>Version Control: Learning Git and Git LFS, and being able to use it efficiently is extremely helpful and important. It is inefficient to use google drive ;)</li>
